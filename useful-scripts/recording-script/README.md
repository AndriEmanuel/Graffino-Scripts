# Recording script

Record all the commands you type and output them into a script file.

## Getting Started

To use the script, you'll just have to include it in your `.bashrc`/`.zshrc` file. 

### Prerequisites

To use this, you just need to have bash or zsh. 

### Description

This script will record all the commands you type in a terminal between `startrecording` and `stoprecording` and output them into a `.sh` file at your choice.

This is very useful when you're creating a shared flow for your team. For example, when you're installing a program and you don't want to do the same work for all your coworkers.
